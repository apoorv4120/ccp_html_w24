        <p>
          Scotch is a 3 year old Shiba Inu. I adopted him as a pup from one of
          my friends, and ever since then he's a part of our little family.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is the most friendly dog I've ever seen. He instantly warms up to
          any guest and loves meeting new people while on a walk.

          Luna is a 1 month old kitten we adopted a couple of days ago. She is
          named after 'Luna Lovegood' from Harry Potter (named by my sister) She
          is the cutest creature on the planet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luna, the adventurous kitten, once turned a mundane day into a
          spectacle by fearlessly scaling a towering bookshelf, leaving a trail
          of chaos and curious smiles in her tiny, mischievous wake.

        <p>
          Yappy is a 2 year old parrot. The name Yappy was kept by my father
          since he keeps yapping the entire day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yappy, the spirited parrot, stole the spotlight at a family gathering
          with his uncanny ability to mimic everyone's laughter, turning a quiet
          evening into a riot of contagious joy.
